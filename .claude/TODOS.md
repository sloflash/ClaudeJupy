# MCP Server Development TODOs

## Creating a Good MCP Server - Improvements for Jupyter Executor

### Current Implementation Strengths
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (daemon, client, MCP server modules)
- ✅ Persistent state management via kernel daemon
- ✅ Virtual environment auto-detection
- ✅ Basic error handling and status reporting
- ✅ Clean architecture using MCP SDK decorators

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Replace print statements with structured logging (use Python logging module)
- [ ] Implement retry logic for kernel communication failures
- [ ] Add detailed error messages with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Create error codes for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Add graceful degradation when kernel is unavailable

#### 2. Resource Management
- [ ] Add configurable timeout mechanisms for long-running code
- [ ] Implement memory usage monitoring and limits
- [ ] Add automatic kernel restart capability on critical errors
- [ ] Implement resource cleanup on shutdown
- [ ] Add connection pooling for multiple clients

#### 3. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Add code execution sandboxing options
- [ ] Implement input validation for file paths
- [ ] Add configurable execution limits (CPU time, memory)
- [ ] Sanitize code inputs to prevent injection
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization for multi-user scenarios

#### 4. Feature Additions
- [ ] Support for multiple concurrent kernels (kernel pool)
- [ ] Kernel session management (save/restore state)
- [ ] Rich output support (images, HTML, LaTeX)
- [ ] Variable inspection tools (list vars, get var info)
- [ ] Code completion and intellisense support
- [ ] Support for different kernel types (R, Julia, etc.)
- [ ] Streaming output for long-running cells
- [ ] Interrupt execution capability

#### 5. Configuration Improvements
- [ ] Make daemon port configurable via environment variables
- [ ] Add YAML/JSON configuration file support
- [ ] Support custom kernel specs and configurations
- [ ] Add connection timeout settings
- [ ] Configurable output size limits

#### 6. MCP Best Practices
- [ ] Add comprehensive tool descriptions with JSON schemas
- [ ] Implement progress reporting for long operations
- [ ] Add cancellation support for running operations
- [ ] Version the API for backward compatibility
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper async/await patterns throughout

#### 7. Testing & Reliability
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit test suite
- [ ] Add integration tests for MCP tools
- [ ] Implement health monitoring and auto-recovery
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create stress tests for concurrent usage

#### 8. Documentation & Developer Experience
- [ ] Create detailed API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples for common scenarios
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add developer setup guide
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams

### Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Core Improvements)**
   - Structured logging
   - Timeout mechanisms
   - Input validation
   - Health checks

2. **Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)**
   - Multiple kernel support
   - Rich output handling
   - Configuration system
   - Progress reporting

3. **Low Priority (Nice to Have)**
   - Additional kernel types
   - Session save/restore
   - Code completion
   - Performance optimizations

### MCP Server Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] **Tool Design**
  - Each tool has a single, clear responsibility
  - Tool names are descriptive and follow naming conventions
  - Parameters are well-documented with types and descriptions
  - Return values are consistent and predictable

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - All exceptions are caught and handled gracefully
  - Error messages are helpful and actionable
  - Failures don't crash the entire server
  - Retry logic for transient failures

- [ ] **Performance**
  - Async operations for I/O bound tasks
  - Efficient resource usage
  - Caching where appropriate
  - Connection pooling for external services

- [ ] **Observability**
  - Structured logging at appropriate levels
  - Metrics for monitoring
  - Tracing for debugging
  - Health endpoints for monitoring

- [ ] **Security**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Secure communication channels
  - No hardcoded secrets

- [ ] **Maintainability**
  - Clean code architecture
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Automated testing
  - Version control and release management

### Notes for Implementation

- Consider using `asyncio` throughout for better concurrency
- Look into using `jupyter-client` async APIs
- Consider implementing a plugin architecture for extensibility
- Think about containerization for easier deployment
- Consider adding telemetry for usage analytics (with user consent)
